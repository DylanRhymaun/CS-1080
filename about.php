            <p>
                Dylan's Bear Blog is run by Dylan Rhymaun, a bear enthusiast living in Burlington, Vermont. Dylan first began researching bears following a close encounter with a Black Bear family as a child when hiking around Shenandoah National Park, in Virginia. He previously ran an instagram page sharing bear pictures and facts.

            <h3>What's the point?</h3>
            <p>
                Despite often being dangerous, or even considered pests in some areas of the world, bears are critical to the health of ecosystems due to their spreading of seeds and regulating populations of other species, such as fish and deer. Protecting bears ensures balanced ecosystems, which benefit human communities and the planet's overall resilience to environmental challenges.
