            <p>Grizzly bears are a subspecies of the American Brown Bear known for being one of the most dangerous animals on Earth. They can grow up to over 700 pounds, yet can move up to speeds of 40 mph. Grizzlies are known for being extremely territorial and protective of their young, so it is advised to avoid getting close to these bears at all costs. <br> This species can be identified by their comparatively large size, and distinct light coffee colored coat. Grizzlies are endangered due to fur hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries which significantly reduced their population.</p>

            <p>Likely the most easily identifiable bear species, the Giant Panda is a symbol of both entire cultures, as well as wildlife protection organizations like the WWF. Despite the immense amount of love out there for these adorable animals, their population is one of the lowest amongst bears due to poaching and habitat loss. <br> Pandas have suchg a unique appearance due to them being a different Genus than all other bears, with only 2 sub species within it; the Giant Panda, pictured, and the Qinglin Panda, which had brown markings instead of black.</p>

            <p>Sloth Bears are a lesser known species of Bear living in India. While they have a similar appearance to American Black Bears, they are distinguished by their unique shaggy coat, long claws, and relaxed demeanor. While they are classified as vulnerable, Sloth Bears are a part of daily life for many Indians, as they rarely become violent. In fact, during the British occupation of India, British officers routinely kept Sloth Bears as pets, and they were sadly also used in circus acts as late as 2009.</p>

            <p>Asiatic Black Bears refer to U. Thibetanus, but consist of over 8 subspecies throughout Asia. All of these species are identifiable visually by their unique "V" mark on their chest, thick necks, and the fact that they are the most likely bear species to walk on two legs. Moreover, Asiatic Black Bears are known as one of the most aggressive bear species, behind Grizzlys and Polar bears, which has resulted in horrific levels of poaching and farming of bear bile throughout history in Asia. Subspecies include:</p>

            <p>Sun Bears, often referring to the subspecies, the Malayan Sun Bear, have a cult following among bear enthusiasts due to their unique appearance - often described as uncannily human. They are easy to identify by their slender coat, distinct brown crest on their chest, and humanlike porportions. Unfortunately, these lovable creatures are one of the most endangered large mammals on the planet, due to habitat loss and deforestation in Southeast Asia, and historic poaching.</p>
